RPi-Photo-Centre
================

Code and design for a Raspberry Pi-based photo controller. THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT YET COMPLETE! DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL ANYTHING FROM THIS REPOSITORY WHILE THIS WARNING REMAINS!

This repository will contain the following:
* Python scripts.
* Crontab entries required to make it go.
* Electronic design for communication with camera, solenoid and cetera.
* Physical wiring layout.

This repository may later contain:
* Magical C++ code to make it go faster.
* Scripts to drive ImageMagick for on-board image processing.

The photo controller is intended eventually to provide:
* Control of solenoid and camera for water-drop photography. (TODO)
* Control of camera and input for laser-LED-based tripwire.
* Control of stepper motors for DFF stacking using a home-made rail drive.
* Control of stepper motors for a panorama head.
* Control of camera for time-lapse photography.
* Control of multiple cameras for bullet-time filming.
